# VBA_Challenge.xlsm

Project Overview
A friend named Steve has asked me to analysis a green stock for his parents to see if it is worth investing in. In order to do this, I needed to use the Visual Basic Appication in Excel to find the stock's total daily volume and annual return. 


Purpose
The purpose of this project was to make an efficient way to look at multiple stocks using VBA. After being able to run the analysis of these 12 different stocks the first, it was apparent that there was a more efficient way to work with the data given.
